## Welcome to CRG Makes

We specialize in open source products involving integrated software and hardware that provides the highest quality user experience. Check out our [website](https://crgmakes.com) and our YouTube channel.

## What Makes Us Different?

We are real people making real products, focused on customer satisfaction and happiness. No robots here or faceless corporations focused on a profits over products.

## What Next?

We are currently developing Aquarius, an open source platform targeting hobbyist woodworks, aimed at automating the workshop to make it a safer place to work.
